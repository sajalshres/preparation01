# Reflection for "The Case Agais Grades" By Alfie Kohn

I've always associated the idea of being enrolled in a class and getting a grade. Grades and classes feel like two faces of the same coin. I've got good grades in almost all of my courses so far. But there have been some instances where my grades were low compared to what I was expecting. While pursuing my undergraduate, I was graded a B in the Cost Accounting course. I felt the grade was too low as I felt that I performed very well in the final exams and project submission. After meeting my professor regarding the grade, I realized that I completed some of the tasks differently than the requirement.

Grades were critical to me during my undergraduate. I was very much focused on getting As in my classes and always took the easiest route to get an A in my assignments, projects, and exams. I didn't explore further outside of the textbooks and course materials. However, I've realized that they don't play a significant role in the real world. Most jobs require you to have good knowledge of the domain and don't really care much about the grade. Most of the companies I've worked for never really cared for my good grades. I've realized that your skillset matters the most in the real world, and your grade plays a tiny part in it.

I believe that if grades are removed from courses, it can change the way we view and approach learning in general. I can shift my focus of motivation from getting good grades to exploring concepts and going beyond the course expectations. To motivate me, I can:

- Get constructive feedback from my professor.
- Explore new ideas and concepts and apply them.
- Risk using an alternative approach to solve a problem that can be creative without worrying about the grade.

Furthermore, removing grades can allow me to be fully be engaged in course materials, participate in fruitful conversations and use more effort to learn.

There are so many instances where I've taken the "easy way out" for doing an assignment. One such instance was submitting our final project for Web Technology class in my undergraduate. We were tasked with creating a website as part of the final project. For the final submission, I could've created a complex and well-designed web page with various technologies that were not part of the requirement. But I took the easy way and created a webpage that fits the requirement perfectly. My rationale at the time was not to risk my final grade and the burden of getting good grades.

I think that grade can be helpful in instances where you want to quantify things like how well a computer model can predict the outcome or the website's overall performance. However, it cannot provide a valid assessment of human intelligence.
